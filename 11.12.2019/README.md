**Constructor and Methods**

**Methods**
  
    Methods are the function which is created within the class the methods can retrun anything 
  
  `Syntax`
  
  ```
  modifier static returnType nameOfMethod (Parameter List)
  {
	// method body
}	
```



**Constructor**

A constructor is similar to a method (but not actually a method) that is invoked automatically when an object is created.The java Complier Identifies the Constructor by its name, Because the ``name of the Constructor and the class is same`` and it don't return anything 

`Syntax`

```
class Test {
    Test( ) {
        // constructor body
    }
}
```
